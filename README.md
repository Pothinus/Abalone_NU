A Random Forest Regression and Linear Regression model was fitted, a linearity assumption was checked by plotting actual vs predicted values, a check for independence of errors was done by plotting the residuals against the observation index, a correlation heatmap was created to check for the collinearity of variables, and finally a histogram was used to check the distribution of residuals.
